<h2>1. Land Preparation</h2>
<p>Plow the field to a fine tilth, breaking up clods and removing weeds. Ensure the soil is well-drained and rich in organic matter.</p>

<h2>2. Seed Selection</h2>
<p>Select high-quality wheat seeds from a reputable source. Choose varieties suited to your climate, soil type, and intended use (e.g., bread wheat, durum wheat).</p>

<h2>3. Sowing</h2>
<p>Sow wheat seeds into well-prepared soil at the appropriate time for your region. Plant seeds at the recommended depth and spacing, typically around 1-2 inches deep and 6-8 inches apart in rows.</p>

<h2>4. Fertilization</h2>
<p>Apply fertilizers containing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium based on soil test results and crop requirements. Fertilize the wheat field before planting and during the growing season as needed.</p>

<h2>5. Irrigation</h2>
<p>Provide sufficient water to the wheat crop, especially during critical growth stages such as germination, tillering, and heading. Irrigate based on soil moisture levels and weather conditions.</p>

<h2>6. Weed Control</h2>
<p>Maintain weed-free conditions in the wheat field through regular cultivation or use of herbicides. Weeds compete with wheat plants for nutrients, water, and sunlight.</p>

<h2>7. Pest and Disease Management</h2>
<p>Monitor the wheat crop regularly for pests such as aphids, armyworms, and wheat rusts, as well as diseases such as powdery mildew and Fusarium head blight. Control pests and diseases using appropriate measures such as cultural practices and pesticides.</p>

<h2>8. Growth and Development</h2>
<p>Monitor the wheat crop as it grows and develops. Provide support if necessary for lodging-prone varieties. Monitor for signs of nutrient deficiencies and address them promptly.</p>

<h2>9. Harvesting</h2>
<p>Harvest wheat when the grains have reached physiological maturity and the moisture content is around 12-14%. Use a combine harvester to cut and thresh the wheat in one operation.</p>

<h2>10. Threshing and Winnowing</h2>
<p>Thresh the harvested wheat to separate the grains from the straw. Winnow the threshed wheat to remove chaff and other debris.</p>

<h2>11. Drying and Storage</h2>
<p>Dry the harvested wheat grains to reduce moisture content to safe storage levels (around 12%). Store the dried wheat grains in clean, dry storage facilities such as silos or grain bins to prevent spoilage and insect infestation.</p>
